# HealpixMPI.jl: an MPI-parallel implementation of the Healpix tessellation scheme in Julia

Welcome to HealpixMPI.jl, an MPI-parallel implementation of the main functionalities of [HEALPix](https://healpix.sourceforge.io/) spherical tessellation scheme, entirely coded in Julia.

This package constitutes a natural extension of the package [Healpix.jl](https://github.com/ziotom78/Healpix.jl), providing an MPI integration of its main functionalities, allowing for high-performances and better scaling on high resolutions.
