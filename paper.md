# Summary

The Julia package `HealpixMPI.jl` constitutes a natural extension of 
`Healpix.jl` [TOCITE], providing an efficient parallelization of its sperical harmonic
transform (SHTs, for short) functionalities.
`Healpix.jl`, in turn, constitutes a Julia-only implementation of the HEALPix [TOCITE]
library, which provides one of the most used tasselation schemes of the two-sphere along with 
a series of SHTs-related functions.
In brief, a spherical harmonic transform can be seen as a sort of two-dimensional Fourier transform defined on
the sphere, which can be used to decompose and analyze any spherically-symmetric field, finding a wide variety of applications.

Moreover, the SHTs often constitute the computationally heaviest step of the scientific software they are part of.
For this reason, many efforts have been spent over the last decades to obtain the fastest and most efficient 
possible SHTs implementations. 
In such setting, parallel computing naturally comes into play, especially for heavy software to be run on high performance 
computing (HPC) large clusters.
Employing a high number of computing cores in the most efficient way in order to perform fast spherical harmonic transform
operations is the main goal of the Julia package `HealpixMPI.jl`, presented in this paper.

**brief description of the main concept: -distribution of objects, - hybrid parallelization**


# Statement of need

Spherical harmonic transforms are particularly relevant for the analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, 
which is one of the most active research field of recent cosmology.
CMB radiation is in fact very conveniently described as a temperature (and polarization) field on the sky sphere, 
making the spherical harmonics the most natural mathematical tool to analyze its measured signal.
From a computational point of view, in order to be stored into arrays, CMB field measurements need to be discretized in some way, 
in other words a mathematically consistent pixelization of the sphere, and the functions defined on it, is required.
This is exactly the goal HEALPix was targeting, when more than two decades ago was released 
quickly becoming the standard library for CMB numerical analysis.

Not surprisingly, this is also the research field wherein `HealpixMPI.jl` was born.
As mentioned before, SHTs are often the bottleneck of CMB analysis pipelines, and as the resolution
of the most recent observational experiments significantly increases, efficient algorithms alone
are no longer enough to perform SHTs in acceptable run times and a parallel approach must be implemented.


As mentioned before, an efficient parallel implementation of the spherical harmonic 
transforms is crucial in the CMB research field for obtaining feasible run times 
when dealing with the most recent astrophyisical observational experiments which 
provide increasingly high resolution.
`HealpixMPI.jl` tackles the problem by providing a hybrid parallelization of the 
computationally heaviest functionalities of `Healpix.jl`, through a simultaneous 
shared-memory (multithreading) and distributed-memory (MPI) parallel implementation.

# Main Features

## The latest SHT engine: DUCC

## Hybrid parallelization of the SHT

## Multi-platform support


# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.
